## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass


### What I learned

I have never nested an image in a button to create a hoverable toggle effect. 

This challenge presented the opportunity to tinker with hoverable toggle effects. It is important to reiterate this because hoverable parts of the challenge presents an opportunity to practice building accessible websites that work for for all users as this can be assessed by the mouse, keybaord and screen readers. 


### Continued development
I intend to continue tinkering with accessibilities features.
